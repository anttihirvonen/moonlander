# Rocketpower

Integrate your Processing sketches with GNU Rocket and take full control of your time-varied parameters. 

Mainly intended to be used for demoscene productions, but also suitable for any animation parameter tuning you want to do.

## Usage

TBD: This library should be in Processing's database (which makes install process pretty much pain-free)

## For developers

Before sending your patch away, please make sure that old tests pass and write tests for your code if necessary. This project uses JUnit for automated testing, because testing Processing libraries by hand is very painful (this was at least my experience when I begun development). Run tests with `ant tests.run`, which builds the library and runs all the tests.
