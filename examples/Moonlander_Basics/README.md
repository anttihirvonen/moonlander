# Moonlander_Basics

This example showcases the basic Moonlander API and shows how you can create a simple effect synchronization to music in Rocket.

If you run the PDE file without opening Rocket, the syncdata is loaded from the provided syncdata.rocket-file. This is the "release mode" and no Rocket installation is needed â€“ when you release your production, you provide the syncdata the exact same way as this example shows. 

However, if you want to edit the data, you must open Rocket, load syncdata.rocket into it and then restart the sketch. You are then free to edit the values in Rocket as you like. You can also open empty project in Rocket and try to sync the sketch completely on your own!

Happy experimenting!
